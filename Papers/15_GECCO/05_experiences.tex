\section{Experiments}

Parameter sampling for SARSA. Range sampled over $\alpha$, $\gamma$, and $\lambda$. What $\epsilon$ was used.

\subsection{Problems}

\subsubsection{Maze}

Originally introduced by Sutton as an example for deterministic problem solving with RL, maze \cite{Sutton1990}.

Evolutionary programming has previously been applied to a multi-task version of Sutton's maze problem \cite{Handa2007}.

\subsubsection{Mountain Car}

Introduced to test RL in sparse coding \cite{sutton1996generalization}

\subsubsection{Puddle World}

Stochastic

Introduced to test RL in sparse coding \cite{sutton1996generalization}

\subsubsection{Actor critic pendulum}

citation \cite{sutton1998introduction}. 

\subsection{Training GRN on one specific problem}

Number of GRN runs, number of generations

\subsection{Generalization of the regulation}

Generalizing from which problems to which other problems. Does training on stochastic and testing on deterministic lead to better GRNs than training on
deterministic then testing on stochastic?
