\section{Introduction}

Transfer and multi-task learning has recently been receiving attention within the reinforcement and machine learning communities \cite{Li2009,Taylor2009}. The ability to generalize between learnable tasks is a challenging ambition, that is far from fully solved, but is achievable, as evidenced by biological organisms capable of generalizing across multiple tasks. In this work we use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) that dynamically tune the parameters of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. This genetically-regulated neuromodulation (GRNM) extends previous results where we showed that GRNM can enhance the learning of agents beyond the performance of traditional fixed parameter RL \cite{Harrington2013}. We apply GRNM to additional problem classes, and show that GRNs evolved on agents learning a subset of problems can facilitate the learning of agents on previously unencountered problems.
