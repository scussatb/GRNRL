\section{Conclusion}
% discrete problems seem harder for the GRN... we need to say that in the conclusion

%\section{Future Work}

As was noted in \cite{Schweighofer2003}, neuromodulation is neither problem nor RL-algorithm specific, thus future work may investigate the application of GRN-neuromodulation on alternative RL algorithms. We have shown that a simple feedback controller can optimize community features of agent-based swarm simulations, the use of GRN-based neuromodulation is likely to further optimize these environmental controllers \cite{Gold2014}.
